Task (BackToStock)

Our customer AmazingCo asked to let users to subscribe products that are out of stock.
The idea is to notify customers when the product back in stock.

At the same time they have already in place premium users and also some users may have priority for particular product categories.
Rules:
- the premium user has a high priority
- users elder than 70 years old has:
  - high priority for medical products
  - medium priority for all categories
- FIFO for all the rest


Criteria (from high to low)

Notes:
you don't need DB
you don't need UI, API, etc
you don't worry about concurrency
focus on domain

Imagine that this is not a test task, but a real production task
